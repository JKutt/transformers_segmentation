# Computational Science Fun Time

This is repo containing all the work and research of my computational science journey.

## Create a conda virtual environment
See [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more on managing conda environments.  

To set up a new conda environment for this project, execute the following in any terminal:  

Create a virtual environment for this service from the environment.yml file:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Contents

#### **Bayesian Inversion**

Notebook containing research and literature on setting up the geophysical inverse problem using Bayesian statistics. 

Topics covered:

- Ensemble Kalmen Inversion


#### **Courses**

Contains research project work for graduate classes 2022-2023. Topics range from NUmercial mathematics to climate science.

#### **Machine Learning**

Notebooks that explore machine learning tools for dta analysis and foundations to learning.

Topics include:
- Gaussian mixture models
- Variation Auto Encoders
- Transformers


#### **PGI**

Core research material for my work with Petrophysically Guided Inversion framework. The work is applied to many geophysical surveys with a primary focus on airborne frequency domain geophysics. By using PGI coupled with joint inversions of multiple geophysical survey types, the goal is to produce mroe geologically meaningful geophysical models.
